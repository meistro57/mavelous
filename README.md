Mavelous
========

Mavelous is a browser-based ground control station (GCS) for
drones/UAVs/micro air vehicles.

A few weeks ago this code was an ugly hack/proof of concept.  Hacker
beware.

Mavelous can be used with any vehicle that speaks the [MAVLink
1.0 protocol](http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start).  It has been
tested with [Arducopter](http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/) and 
[ArduPlane](http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/).

Here's a screenshot of Mavelous running in a desktop web browser:

Requirements
------------

Mavelous depends on [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/),
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and a small set of JavaScript
libraries managed with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).  The Python
packages can be installed with `pip`:

    $ pip install flask cherrypy

The JavaScript dependencies and bundled client code are built with
Webpack.  To install the dependencies and build the bundle run:

    $ npm install
    $ npm run build

Mavelous has two main parts:

1. Front end.  This is the HTML application that runs in a browser.

2. Server.  The server manages communication between the front end and
the drone.  It has a web server that talks to the front end, and it
sends and receives drone commands using a wireless modem (like an
[XBee radio](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9099) or a [3D Robotics
radio](https://store.diydrones.com/3DR_Radio_USB_915_Mhz_Ground_module_p/br-3drusb915.htm)).

The front end and the server can run on the same computer, or on two
different computers.

The server is written in Python, and probably requires a laptop or
netbook.  The front end is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript, and can run
on anything with a web browser, including phones and tablets.


Why
---

Portability.  Controlling a drone with an iPad is kind of awesome, and
there are currently no open-source ground control stations that can
run on an iPhone or iPad--Mavelous can (at least the front end can).

The most popular ArduCopter GCS, [APM Mission
Planner](http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/wiki/Mission), is
primarily a Windows application.  It can run under OS X and Linux with
Mono, but the experience is not always smooth.

The goal of Mavelous is to have a highly portable GCS that can talk to
anything that speaks the MAVLink protocol (and hopefully
[ROS](http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/software/ros-platform)
devices, too, some day).

How to run it
-------------

### With a real drone

1. Connect your ArduCopter or ArduPlane to your computer with an Xbee or
   3DR Radio. Power on the vehicle.

2. Start mavproxy, specifying the serial port and correct data rate. For 3DR Radios, the
   data rate is usually 57600.  For example:

    ```
    $ python mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyUSB0 --baud=57600
    ```

3. At the mavproxy prompt, load the mmap module:

    ```
    STABILIZE> module load mmap
    ```

A web browser will open showing you the Mavelous interface, or you can point a browser to http://localhost:9999.

You'll be able to use the Mavelous interface to control Guided mode once in
flight. Find out more about guided mode on [ArduCopter](http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/wiki/AC2_GuidedMode).

### Software in the loop simulation ArduCopter

1. Compile the ArduCopter firmware for Software in the loop similation (SITL).
   You'll need to use the ardupilot-mega project's Makefile build system:
   see detals on the [ardupilot-mega wiki](http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/wiki/BuildingWithMake).

   ```
   $ make sitl
   ```
2. Run the ArduCopter executable in desktop mode.  For example:

    ```
    $ ~/ardupilot-mega/tmp/ArduCopter.build/ArduCopter.elf -H 20
    ```
   On some systems, this directory will be found at `/tmp/ArduCopter.build/`

2. Start the simulated multicopter.  For example:

    ```
    $ python ~/ardupilot-mega/Tools/autotest/pysim/sim_multicopter.py \
      --frame=+ --rate=400 --home=34.092047,-118.267136,20,0 --wind=6,45,.3
    ```

3. Start mavproxy:

    ```
    $ python mavproxy.py --master=tcp:127.0.0.1:5760 --out=127.0.0.1:14550 \
      --aircraft=test.ArduCopter --sitl=127.0.0.1:5501 --out=127.0.0.1:19550 \
      --quadcopter --streamrate=5
    ```

4. At the mavproxy prompt, load the mmap module:

    ```
    GUIDED> module load mmap
    ```

A web browser will open showing you the Mavelous interface, or you can point a browser to http://localhost:9999



Feature status
--------------

Currently Mavelous is capable of monitoring and guiding a drone in flight.

* You can see basic flight data (speed, altitude, attitude) on the primary 
  flight display.
* You can double click/tap on the map to send the drone to that location.
* Multiple users can control the same drone.

We're working to add the following features soon:

* Control auto takeoff, loiter, and landing of an ArduCopter
* Mission creation and editing
* Offline support (map caching)

I'd like to add these features:

* Multi-vehicle control
